## Project Intro
Green Fitness tools was designed after researching The Green Gym, a community of volunteers seeking to take care of the environment while putting an emphasis on health and fitness through their activity. At first, I created a possible version in green space where people have ecological consideration while taking care of themselves body, then I thought it would be worth exploring this further by creating more professional gym tools which would work in the context of nature. It might propose a new possibility for people who would like to either take professional gym training outside or reduce the potential risk of body pain caused by gardening. The purpose would be to fulfill individual human nature in an ecological context.  
绿色健身工具是在对英国伦敦”The Green Gym” 新部落运用服务设计和用户体验设计方法调研后产生的交互项目。该社区是一个致力于保护环境，同时强调在园林劳动中舒展身心，健身强体。首先，我在绿色空间中创建了一个可能的版本，在该版本中人们在考虑自己的身体健康同时要考虑生态因素，然后我认为通过创建更适合自然环境的更专业的健身工具来进一步探索这一点是值得的。这可能为那些希望接受室外体育馆专业培训或减少园艺带来的潜在身体疼痛风险的人们提出了一种新的可能性。该项目旨在帮助人们在生态环境中满足个人利益（心理和生理）以及实现团队价值。

## Neotribe
Neotribes (Mafessoli, 2000 ) are groups of people together with common purpose either for themselves or society, but is ephemeral at the time. It is not a totally new form of society but based on the static social fabric  and spiritual life of modern people.  
新部落（Mafessoli，2000）是一群有共同目的人为自己或社会而建立，但在当时是短暂的。它不是一种全新的社会形式，而是建立在静态社会结构和现代精神生活的基础上的社区文化。
<br />

## The Green Gym
The green gym is self-sustaining community run by TCV, the Conservation volunteers, which combined people’s physical activities with local environmental project. It is a little bit adhocracy organization since it relies on flexible integrative behavior based on volunteers’ spontaneity but break down the people’s social isolation, contributing to community cohesion through various group activities.  
“The Green Gym” 是由环境保护志愿者TCV协会运营的自我维续的社区。它将人们的体育活动与当地的环境项目结合在一起。这是一个无固定结构的组织（adhocracy），因为它依赖于志愿者自发性的灵活整合行为。然而该组织打破了人们之间的社会隔离，通过各种集体活动促进了社区凝聚力。

<br />

## Research for TCV
以下是我作为志愿者参与活动所做的调研报告。报告分析了该组织与Neotribe理论支持的相似性，以及社区活动后的参与者的初始期望与结果收获的比较分析。在与参与者做访谈的过程中发现了设计问题与可行性。其外，组织活动里的所用到的物品的尺寸，材料，功能为设计提供设计对象以及大社会未来干预设计提供理论支持。

## Idears Generation
Sustainability: Sustainability focuses on meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. The concept of sustainability is composed of three pillars: economic, environmental, and social—also known informally as profits, planet, and people (Grant and Kenton,2019).  
可持续发展的重点是满足当前的需求，而不损害子孙后代满足其需求的能力。可持续性的概念由三个支柱组成：经济，环境和社会，也被非正式地称为利润，地球和人。（Grant和Kenton，2019）
<br />

Transaction: I supposed an object that could transfer the people’s contribution to the nature into the economic reward. It should Body reveal the relationship between individ- Care ual contribution and society(environment ) benefit. That means people give themselves in nature with initiative on body health and also get something from nature. Actually, this idea shows the big society concept in a natural environment setting.  
我认为一个对象物体（object）可以将人们对自然的贡献转为经济的回报。它应该展现个人贡献和社会环境利益的关系。这意味着人们自发的具有主动性的投入自然的怀抱并从自然中收获财富。
<br />

Dynamic Gardening：I supposed an idea that encourage people join in by increasing gardening professional exercise. It is a social object that promote communication adding the spice in garden and help people exaggerate the movement in order to avoid back pain and muscle overused.  
我提出通过增加园艺专业性锻炼来鼓励人们参与。该设计是一个社交对象，可以促进交流，在花园中增添乐趣，并帮助人们规范健身园艺动作，在锻炼肌肉的同时以避免过度使用带来的伤痛。

## Methodology
I created the first vision of green fitness to test how garden tools are used as the fitness tool by human. It showed a series of gym fitness such as kettlebell, pull-upstation, dumbbell. After discussing with others, some critical points are worth noticing:  
我创建了绿色健身的第一个愿景，以测试园艺工具如何被人类用作健身工具。它显示了一系列体育锻炼，例如壶铃，引体向上，哑铃。与他人讨论后，一些关键点值得注意：
<br />

- Haptic stimuli are very important from nerve ending to our mind.  
- handle designed should meet ergonomics principles.  
- question: where to put it? what context (situation) of green fitness might happen?  
- And how to use it  
- how to generate interaction?  
- 从神经末梢到我们的大脑，触觉刺激非常重要。  
- 设计的手柄应符合人体工程学原理。  
- 问题：放在哪里？绿色健身房可能发生的环境？  
- 以及如何使用  
- 如何产生互动？

## Prototype
The drawing to show how does green fitness work on people.I re-design totally 6 re-tools for green fitness and create the whole routine of how to use them  
<Image src="/green_gym/gym_06.png" className="my-6 rounded-lg" />
<br />

## Design Vision
I tried to model what kind of facilities could be in the future. The vision contains a set of professional tool assem- bled in future green fitness but keep its function towards gardening task, which including five machines and one cloth to help user increase body strength of chest, biceps, back, triceps quads, glutes muscle. I tested the usability of machine by making paper modeling which help me modify the right size of handle, right angle of body ges- ture. Besides, the machine was applied in ergonomic prin- ciples in order to provide comfortable experience.

## Interface
Interface was designed to show the status of the body workout, and the relationship with local environments. It keep the functions as the gym machine but facilitate body fitness through energy transferable theory and message of mind and gestures instruction delivered。  
界面旨在显示锻炼状态以及与周围环境的关系。它可以保持室内健身机的功能，也能通过能量传递理论以及传递的心理信息和手势指令来促进绿色健身。
<br />

Every activity has a value called a "MET value" which calculates the energy required for that activity. Multiplying MET value by weight in kilograms tells you calories burned per hour  
<br />

Calories:  MET*weight in kg=calories/hour  
Mat was set a little bit lager than reference, since fitness was promote by machine.
<br />

I chose the MPU module to detect the velocity of movment, which should be put into angle points. By calculating acceleration speed via three direction and formula to get the calorie. PulseSensor is put on the handle position. The energy transfer information should be based on the gardening experience and set the algorithm to get it.

I tried to test the arduino connected with two sensors, And it can get some data from it. I tried move the object and let the screen display the movement.However, I am always trying to write a simple algorithm to calculate the calorie based on the speed and I need to figure out how to calculate the time people using the green tool. For example, When MPU- detect the velocity , time starts. When movement disappears, time ends. Is that user-friendly for people.
