# Ultra Object-Time Synchronization

`2018.12-2019.04`  `Interaction designer`  `Arduino, GPS sensor, processing`

## Project intro
**Ultra-Object** refers to objects that go above, beyond or outside the realms of what would normally be considered the concrete and stable nature of objects throughout design history. With an increasing amount of objects networked, either through technologies like the Internet of Things and automation or through the nature of globalised production chains, objects no longer exist as discrete, solid things but as near ‘hyperobjects’ - existing across multiple times and spaces. For instance, your phone also exists on a server centre somewhere as well as triangulated by cell towers and with a product ID that traces all the parts through history and future. It is ‘more than the sum of its parts.

Interaction design has always been a site for the critique of the social and cultural role of technology.Something that is hidden or not normally visible. Invisible systems might include things like GPS, surveillance and Wi-fi as well as things that are imperceptible to humans, like high-frequency trading or global warming.

I designed GPS signals data move around earth’s rotation, time synchronization move around data and earth. Time didn’t show intact seconds cause original data is lack of this time. it showes “lost ” in time. And in this case,installation has successfully intervention in the invisible system.   Every data was rendering in HSB color mapped with “distance from satellite ”. The shape of data is cube structure in accordance with receiver analogue to show space the connection between time and space.

The data was analyzed based on two relationship between altitude, distance from satellite -two geometrical information with horizontal dilution of precision. HDOP represents time vary in time synchronization due to continuously changes of position of the selected satellites (Hargrave 2001, page1). I tried to uncommon dimention to show how human to see the time and space.It cost me almost two weeks to accomplish all settings use JAVA language in processing. It was a big challenge.
